I think I might buy the other two colors available as well. üòÑ,L,B0B556VGFJ

The best maternity dress,5.0,"I am height 5'3"" and weigh about 67kg, went for size XL.This is the best most satisfying garment purchase I have made on Amazon. It is soooo pretty, the pastel colors look so calming. The stitching quality is excellent. The invisible zippers are sturdy and put in so neatly. Overall dress cutting is done very symmetrically and stitched perfectly. This dress has ties too, can tie at front or back. The material is cotton, it's a tad bit transparent (wish it was a bit thicker).I have both yellow and blue in it, and I am going to purchase the peach one too, as I just absolutely loved the dress. This is the best product from Zuvimo, keep up the great quality :)The price (499) is actually so reasonable, you hardly find good stuff at this price range ESPECIALLY for maternity wear. I appreciate this dress so much and wear it so often :)",XL,B0B556VGFJ

Sleeve length is 3/4, the nursing zip both side works well and the thread to tie behind the waist for a good fit is also fine. Nothing is torn or spoilt in the outfit, i have not washed it yet so dont know about the colour bleed and shrinkage. Overall i like the fit, color & quality of the outfit.",L,B08VJ2G3Q7

My height is 150 cms and the kurti length is also 150 cms almost. So it looks like nighty for me. It will look good for tall girls.- first time wash it with hand since it will loose Colors.- fabric material so good. Very good quality.- zippers also working good and they are not that visible- this is my 3rd purchase from this seller. Really awesome products and service.- dress is fitting perfectly.- color is so bright as shown in picture.- packaging was good. And delivered safely.- the only con is the price is too high.- we can give between 500-600But 999/- is very very high.- it was necessary for me so I didn't see the money and I purchased 4 products from the same seller.,M,B07K6P56P5
