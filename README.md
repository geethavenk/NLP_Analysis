This project, undertaken for Neemai, a clothing brand in India, aims to identify the sentiments surrounding maternity wear in the country. To achieve this, customer review data for maternity wear dresses was scraped from Amazon India. Sentiment analysis was performed on this data, and specifically, bi-grams and tri-grams were identified. The word clouds generated from the review data provided valuable insights into customer opinions.
